# CharityGiveaway

I'm developing a website where users can share their goods with those in need. Easy to use multistep form will guide you to choose the charity and provide all necessary information to schedule a pickup date.

## How to use?

Currently WIP but if you want you can clone this repository and then open the project in your IDE.
I'm using InteliJ Idea and if you too, then simply go to File > Open.. and choose the folder where you've cloned repository.
Any feedback is very appreciated and if you want to contribute just make a pullrequest with your suggestions!
